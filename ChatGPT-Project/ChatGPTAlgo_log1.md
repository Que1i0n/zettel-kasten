**produce a generative art project ruleset using only dice, the KJV bible, and a notepad**

	One possible generative art project ruleset using only dice, the KJV Bible, and a notepad could be as follows:
	
	1. Roll a six-sided die to determine the number of words that will be used in the artwork. This number will represent the total number of words that will be selected from the Bible and used in the final artwork.
	
	2. Use the notepad to randomly select the specified number of words from the Bible. These words will serve as the building blocks for the artwork.
	
	3. Roll a six-sided die to determine the overall composition of the artwork. This could include things like the number and arrangement of shapes, the use of color, and the overall layout of the artwork.
	
	4. Use the selected Bible words to create the artwork according to the composition determined in step 3. The words could be used as labels for different shapes or elements in the artwork, or they could be used to create a visual representation of the words themselves.
	
	5. Roll a six-sided die to determine any additional constraints or parameters that will be imposed on the artwork. These could include things like a maximum number of colors that can be used, a specific arrangement of shapes or elements, or any other creative constraints that the artist wants to impose.
	
	6. Use the ruleset to create multiple unique artworks, varying the selected Bible words, the composition, and the additional constraints in each iteration to produce a diverse collection of generative artworks.

For each character in the phrases, use the notepad to assign a corresponding value for the intensity and saturation of the pixels in the artwork. For example, a character such as "a" could correspond to a low intensity and high saturation, while a character such as "z" could correspond to a high intensity and low saturation.
	
	Roll two six-sided dice to determine the aspect ratio of the final image. The aspect ratio will be equal to the sum of the two dice rolls divided by 10 (e.g. a roll of 4 and 6 would give an aspect ratio of 1.0, while a roll of 3 and 5 would give an aspect ratio of 0.8). The aspect ratio will determine the relative height and width of the final image.
	
	Roll three six-sided dice to determine the maximum and minimum values for the red, green, and blue channels in the RGB color space. The minimum value for each channel will be equal to the result of the lowest dice roll to the power of the middle dice roll, while the maximum value for each channel will be equal to the result of the middle roll to the power of the highest dice roll.
	
	Use the notepad to randomly select colors that fall within the specified range for each channel in the RGB color space. These colors will be used in the final artwork.
	
	Roll two six-sided dice to determine any additional constraints or parameters that will be imposed on the artwork. These could include things like a specific arrangement of shapes or elements, or any other creative constraints that the artist wants to impose. The specific constraints will be determined based on the sum of the dice rolls.
	
	Use the selected colors, Bible phrases, and their placement in the artwork, as well as any additional constraints, to create the final artwork. Use the ruleset to create multiple unique artworks, varying the selected Bible phrases, their placement, the selected colors, and the additional constraints in each iteration to produce a diverse collection of generative artworks.
