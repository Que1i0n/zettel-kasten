**This will determine the number of phrases that will be used in the artwork.**

	1. Roll two six-sided dice and sum the two dice rolls.

**This will give the interval at which the selected phrases will be spaced throughout the Bible.**

	2.  Roll two six-sided dice, use the notepad to record this roll. Then randomly select a page number from the Bible, divide the total number of words on the page by the page number.  

**These groups of words will form the phrases that will be used in the artwork, as well as the basis for the arrangement parameters.**

	3.  Starting at the beginning of the Bible, use the notepad to select every nth group of words, where n is the interval determined in step 2. 

**This will determine the position of the phrases within the artwork.**

	4.  For each selected phrase, use the notepad to determine a feature of the phrase (such as the number of words, the first letter, or the last letter) and use that feature to determine the phrase's placement in the artwork. 
		For example, if the number of words in the phrase is used as the determining factor, a phrase with three words could be placed in the top left corner of the artwork, while a phrase with six words could be placed in the bottom right corner.

**This will generate the artwork**

	5. Use the selected Bible phrases and their corresponding placement rolls to create the artwork. The phrases could be used as labels for different shapes or elements in the artwork, or they could be used to create a visual representation of the words themselves.

**This will limit the colour range**

	6. Roll three six-sided dice to determine the maximum and minimum values for the red, green, and blue channels in the RGB color space. The minimum value for each channel will be equal to the sum of the two lowest dice rolls, while the maximum value for each channel will be equal to the sum of the two highest dice rolls.

**This will define aspect ratio**

	7.  Roll two six-sided dice to determine the aspect ratio of the final image. The aspect ratio will be equal to the sum of the two dice rolls divided by 10 (e.g. a roll of 4 and 6 would give an aspect ratio of 1.0, while a roll of 3 and 5 would give an aspect ratio of 0.8). The aspect ratio will determine the relative height and width of the final image.

**This will select the colour pallettes**

	8. Use the notepad to randomly select colors that fall within the specified range for each channel in the RGB color space. These colors will be used in the final artwork.

**Any other additional constraints**

	9. Roll two six-sided dice to determine quantity of any additional constraints or parameters that will be imposed on the artwork. 
		These could include things like a specific arrangement of shapes or elements, or any other creative constraints that the artist wants to impose. The specific constraints will be determined based on the sum of the dice rolls.

**This will create a collection (ie. iterate)**

	10. Use the selected colors, Bible phrases, and their placement in the artwork, as well as any additional constraints, to create the final artwork. Use the ruleset to create multiple unique artworks, varying the selected Bible phrases, their placement, the selected colors, and the additional constraints in each iteration to produce a diverse collection of generative artworks.
