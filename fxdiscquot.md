#### You'll have got here from a link somewhere; should've told you what it is.

	it's just my personal taste / experience whenever I try some random color gen algo, I tend to not like the green-purple ones, and when I filter them out, it generally looks better. even just filtering the green, because it's the fault of green, cause purple is actually very beautiful colour
	    greens are for eating and smoking
	    trust me, I once read part of a book about colour theory
